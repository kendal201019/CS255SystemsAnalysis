Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
•	The client for this project is DriverPass. They specialize in providing driving lessons to their clients who are in interested obtaining a driver’s license. DriverPass were interested in a system that would allow them provide internet access to lessons, progress reports, scheduling of in person lessons to their students. 

What did you do particularly well?
•	The things that I did particularly well in my opinion was that I took the time to really get a grasp of what the client requested. Completing the business requirement documents allowed me to define the objective and goals, determine non-functional and functional requirements, as well as constraints. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
•	I think I would revise the Business Requirements Document. This was my first time completing one of these forms. I feel as though the more industry experience I gather, the better I will be able to fill out these types of documents. Providing more clarity. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
•	To interpret the user’s needs I read over the provided materials, which in this example consisted of minutes of a meeting the owner and IT officer of DriverPass had with our team. I read over the materials and highlighted all the requests that DriverPass made in that meeting. User needs are important, because we want to focus on a delivering a product that functions as requested by the customer. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
•	To design software, we would first start by meeting with the persons requesting the software. We would do several rounds of meetings to build a business requirement document that details exactly how the system is to function. We would then create a timeline of when each part of the system must be completed. Testing along the way.
